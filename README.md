# Mandelbrot Experiments

Canvas, WASM, WebWorkers, WebGL, and WebGPU.

# How to get started

1. clone
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn dev -o`
5. Click on some links, click the "Run" button and see things work (or break, depending on your browser)

# Supported browsers

- WebWorkers and WebGL are supported on all major browsers.
- WASM should work on all browsers, but could be blocked by security settings.
- WebGPU tested working on Chrome on Windows, and Firefox Nightly on Linux. (Safari might work, I don't have a Mac)
