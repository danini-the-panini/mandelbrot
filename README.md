# Mandelbrot Experiments

I know, it's a rails project. This started out with me seeing how Typescript works with Rails + Stimulus, and very quickly evolved into having fun with canvas, web workers, and webgl.

# How to get started

1. clone
2. `bin/setup`
3. `bin/rails s`
4. Go to `localhost:3000` in your favourite browser
5. Click on some links, click the "Run" button and see things work (or break, depending on your browser)
